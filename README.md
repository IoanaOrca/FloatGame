### Made with love by Ioana Orca @Ironhack

## **It's a** brain training game. Learn new words and expand your vocabulary.

**Game play:**

**The user can** tap the matching word to keep the baloon floating.
**Features:** the user wins 400 points if guessing the synonym inunder 5 seconds amnd pumps the air baloon up.

**Chalenges:**

- media queries
- structure canvas ontopof html
- bulding game logic

**Lessons learned:**

- how to debug | no console.log
- dealing with time intervals

If I were to start from scratch I would spend more time building game architecture.

**I would really like to improove:**

- design and CSS
- add sounds and animations
